I am T.M. Sajith Priyankara, a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics and a Graduate Part-Time Instructor at Texas Tech University. 

My research focuses on functional data analysis, statistics on manifolds, multivariate analysis, and object data analysis. I am particularly interested in real-world applications in bioinformatics and public health.
